# Big-Data-Systems-Indexing

In this project, we will develop a REST Api to parse a JSON schema model divided into three demos

## Prototype demo 1
### Develop a Spring Boot based REST Api to parse a given sample JSON schema.
### Save the JSON schema in a redis key value store.
### Demonstrate the use of operations like GET, POST and DELETE for the first prototype demo.

## Prototype demo 2
### Regress on your model and perform additional operations like PUT and PATCH.
### Secure the REST Api with a security protocol like JWT or OAuth2.

## Prototype demo 3
### Adding Elasticsearch capabilities
### Using RedisSMQ for REST API queueing
